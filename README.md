### Comprehensive Integration of Urban Mobility and Transport Safety Data for Abu Dhabi's Smart City Planning

#### Overview
This project aims to integrate multiple datasets related to public transportation, renewable energy, and healthcare utilization in Abu Dhabi for the year 2025. The primary goal is to enhance urban planning strategies by identifying patterns and high-risk areas in transportation and healthcare service delivery.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas Library

#### Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the Pandas library if you haven't already:
    bash
    pip install pandas
    

#### Dataset Preparation
- Download the datasets and ensure they are in the same directory as your script:
  - **Public_Transportation_Usage_Abu_Dhabi_2025.csv**
  - **Traffic_Accident-v3.0_Abu_Dhabi_2025.xlsx**

#### Running the Analysis
- Save the provided Python script in a file, for example, `urban_mobility_analysis.py`.
- Run the script using the command line:
  bash
  python urban_mobility_analysis.py
  

#### Understanding the Output
- **High Risk Areas**: Lists locations with the highest number of accidents and public transport users.
- **Peak Times for Traffic Accidents**: Displays the times with the highest frequency of traffic accidents.

This analysis helps urban planners and policymakers to optimize transportation routes and improve safety measures in Abu Dhabi's urban environment.
